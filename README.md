# data-fest-2018
Submission to American Statistical Association DataFest 2018 hosted at Duke University.

This project aggregates job posting data into metropolitan areas and looks at the relative proportions of availability of jobs in certain industries. I created a visualization in Tableau that shows which cities have lots of opportunities for a given industry. You can view it here: [Industry Activity by US Metropolitan Area](https://public.tableau.com/profile/miles.turpin#!/vizhome/industry-activity-revised/Dashboard1 "Industry Activity by US Metropolitan Area").
